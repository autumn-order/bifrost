# Table Naming Scheme

Table enums should be named in the format of

```
MaintainerModuleTableName...
```

Maintainer can be a character, organization, corporation, etc. It is used to identify who exactly the module belongs to.

## Example

```
BifrostAuthUser
```

Which would be the table

```
bifrost_auth_user
```

    ```sh
    cargo run -- up -n 10
    ```

    ```sh
    cargo run -- down
    ```
- Rollback last 10 applied migrations
    ```sh
    cargo run -- down -n 10
    ```
- Drop all tables from the database, then reapply all migrations
    ```sh
    cargo run -- fresh
    ```

    ```
